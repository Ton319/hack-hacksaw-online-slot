# Hacksaw Hate me ;)

Simply put, the idea isn't about the API, I have the whole game, and I could expose everything, but why? Let's give these disappointing casinos a bit of a hard time!



## I'll explain the idea simply, like an (FAQ)

#### **How will I win? A program? A script? An app?**

Definitely not! All Hacksaw games operate through a strongly protected API with multiple layers of security, and a database with over a billion round records in an Oracle archive. I won't reveal too much.

#### **More importantly, if there was a way (as you claim), why haven't you done it?**

Do you think I'm foolish enough to expose myself? What if someone, for example, paid you 1 million, and you gave them a x5000 win in the game Dead or Wild with a 1500 bet? The equation is fair between me and a player who has a large archive of these big hits. ^^ There's a lot to explain.

#### **Can it be done more than once? Is the offer valid for everyone?** 

No, how do I explain this... You understood from the above explanation, I think? You're smart, right?

#### **What games can achieve Max Win?**

Explained before, only Hacksaw slot games work, scratch games don't work at all, and I advise everyone to stay away from them as they're 99.9999999% deceptive.

#### **Are you a representative from Hacksaw, claiming that I'm lying?**

The fun will also start as we introduce you to some distinguished gentlemen:

- Cristian: The Scorpion Head
- Luke: The Unique Personality
- Margarita: The Kind Girl
- Philippa: I won't reveal too much. ^^
- Eugenia: Don't always disagree with T..
- Anna: Honestly, you're of no use
- And last but not least, the Head of the Snake, **MarcusOoO**

and simple map maybe enough ;)

#### **How do we start the fun?**

You have the right to see all the evidence, but please don't tell me, 'Give me Max win, then I'll give you your cut or share.' Reflect on what I've said before, and you'll know from where and how I work. Contact me below.
